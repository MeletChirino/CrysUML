# Welcome to CrysUML
By: Melet Chirino Caicedo

This is an open-source tool used for project planning using the standards of SysUML. There are plenty of tools like this but very few are gitable, that's why I created it.

The result are a bunch of md files that show all details of your project. For diagrams I used the plantuml library.

So far you can do Exigences, UseCase diagrams, Sequence diagrams, logic and physic architecture of your system. Im working in a script that can organize activities the scrum way with epics, user histories and milestones within a gantt diagram. Later I would like to upload this activities automatically to github.

[Installing](https://github.com/MeletChirino/CrysUML/wiki/Install) and [using](https://github.com/MeletChirino/CrysUML/wiki/Use) instrucctions are in the [wikis](https://github.com/MeletChirino/CrysUML/wiki/Home) page of this repo (if everything goes fine I will upload it to PyPi). If you have any problem don't mind to contact me.
